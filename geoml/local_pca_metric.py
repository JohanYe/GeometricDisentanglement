    corresponding to the inverse (reciprocal) of the local variance, which
    is defined as

                    This should be a NxD torch Tensor correspondong to
                    N observations of dimension D.
            sigma:  The width of the Gaussian window used to define
                    locality when computing weights. This must be a positive
                    scalar.
